# Robot Axe Library
[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/CaiqueCoelho/robot-axe-library/blob/master/LICENSE)

This projext is a RobotFramework Library wrapper for axe-selenium-python pakage. In this project we abstracted the entire library setup for use in robotframework and also implemented the entire interface for communicating with the AXE library allowing to define specific filters to look for accessibility issues in addition to allowing the necessary assertions on the test side, for your your test passes or fails depending on the configuration you want, allowing a maximum number of issues, excluding elements you don't want to analyze, and allowing you to define specific accessibility rules, levels, tags and impact.
